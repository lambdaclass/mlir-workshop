If you reached this by following all the steps, you should now have a (really) minimal working language, well done!

## Some projects to check out

- [Cairo native](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo_native) makes extensive use of MLIR.
- [Concrete](https://github.com/lambdaclass/concrete) first codegen backend is made with MLIR, this should be easier to read than Cairo Native code.
